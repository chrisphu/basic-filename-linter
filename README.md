# basic-filename-linter

The [`basic-filename-linter.py`](https://github.com/chrisphu/basic-filename-linter/blob/main/basic_filename_linter.py) Python script renames files within a given directory to:
1. Be all lowercase
2. Have spaces and hyphens replaced with underscores

# How to use

>[!WARNING]
>Running this will immediately begin the renaming process. Ensure you have supplied the correct desired directory path.

Run `py basic_filename_linter.py {directory path}`.

# This is very limited â€“ any plans to upgrade?

No. This was just a quick thing I wrote to get some personal files a bit more organized. [ls-lint](https://github.com/loeffel-io/ls-lint) looks like a much more powerful and useful tool (that I naturally only found after I finished seeing if I could write something in this vein).
